# hello-world

I am a Computer Science student at Western Governor University.

I have always been fascinated by how things work and growing up, I was constantly getting into trouble for breaking things and trying to figure how they work.
I decided to pursue an Associate degree in Computer and Electronic Technology after serving in the United States Marine Corp.  
I thouroughy enjoyed working with electornics and troubleshooting them and fixing the broken product.  I have spent five years repairing electronics ranging from HMI, PC to AED(defibulator).
I have learned so much during my time as an electonic technecian.  However, I had to resign from my position due to an amazing oppurtunity with my wife's work to move to Germany.
